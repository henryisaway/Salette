# Jynx

Jynx is a custom general-purpose 2D/3D graphics engine designed for flexibility, performance, and ease of use. Built on C++ with a (yet-to-come) high-level Lua API, Jynx aims to provide tools for creating visual experiences, whether in gaming or other graphical applications.

> Note: Jynx is a personal, non-profit and educational project being developed by me alone, and is currently under heavy development. The engine is far from feature complete and ETA for new features may change over time.

## Features

- **Lightweight**: Good for fast rendering and efficient resource management.
- **Flexible API**: A high-level Lua interface allows for easier scripting and rapid iteration.
- **Mod-Friendly Architecture**: Designed to facilitate modding in games, ensuring ease of use for both developers and end-users.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Initially implemented on OpenGL, with plans for support across multiple graphical APIs.
- **Asset Management**: Future features include a comprehensive asset manager to streamline asset handling.
- **Support for 2D and 3D Rendering**: Capable of rendering both 2D and 3D graphics.
- **Custom Shaders**: Create stunning visuals with the ability to implement custom shaders.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **C++17 or higher**: Ensure you have a compatible C++ compiler.
- **CMake**: Required for building the project.
- **OpenGL**: Make sure you have the OpenGL libraries installed.
